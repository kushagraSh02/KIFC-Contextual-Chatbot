# KIFC-Contextual-Chatbot
A chatbot for my imaginary KIFC organization.

A simple contextual chatbot for an organization called Kushagra's India Fighting Championship.

Contextual chatbot are advanced chatbots that figure out the intent behind a customer query or interaction with the help of Natural Language Processing(NLP)

I have used Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK) to process the textual information for the bot and LSTM(Long short-term memory) layer to train the model. 

LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network can process not only single data points, but also entire sequences of data, so the intent or meaning of sentence is not lost in training.

The chatbot can answer a person's general query like how to apply, where are the centres of the organization etc by finding the intent or meaning of the user query and then searching for an answer appropriate for that meaning.
